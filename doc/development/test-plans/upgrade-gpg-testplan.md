title: Test plan for `GnuPG` related component upgrade (gnupg, gpgme, libassuan, libgcrypt, libgpg-error, libksba, npth)
---

Copy the following test plan to a comment of the merge request that upgrades the component.

````markdown
## Test plan
- [ ] Performed a successful GitLab Enterprise Edition (EE) build on all supported platforms (include `build-package-on-all-os` job).
- [ ] Installed and started GitLab in a VM or container with a package you built in the previous task.
- [ ] Created a GPG key.
  1. Sign in to GitLab.
  1. Create a new project, clone it locally .
  1. Go to "Edit Profile > Emails" and copy the verified linked email. Export it as an environment variable:
  ```shell
   export GITLAB_EMAIL="ADD_EMAIL_HERE"
  ```
  - Generate a gpg key pair. Sample on how to do it from the gpg docs below.
  ```shell
   export GNUPGHOME="$(mktemp -d)"
    cat >foo <<EOF
      %echo Generating a basic OpenPGP key
      Key-Type: DSA
      Key-Length: 1024
      Subkey-Type: ELG-E
      Subkey-Length: 1024
      Name-Real: GPG Tester
      Name-Comment: some comment
      Name-Email: $GITLAB_EMAIL
      Expire-Date: 1
      Passphrase: abc
      # Do a commit here, so that we can later print "done" :-)
      %commit
      %echo done
    EOF
  gpg --batch --generate-key foo
  gpg --list-signatures --keyid-format LONG | grep pub
  gpg --armor --export "$GITLAB_EMAIL"
  ```
- [ ] Configured the GPG key.
  - Edit your profile and add the gpg key listed. 
  - After importing your gpg key copy its ID from the profile page. It is the first string shown. Its short version is also visible as the output from the gpg --list-signatures command above.
  ```shell
   export GPG_KEY_ID="CHANGE_THIS_KEY_ID"
  ```
  - Locally, in the cloned repo configure git to use your key and email
  ```shell
   git config --local user.signingkey "$GPG_KEY_ID"
   git config --local user.email "$GITLAB_EMAIL"
  ```
- [ ] Verified the GPG key works correctly.
  - Add some content to your repo, add it to the index and then commit, sign, and push:
  ```shell
   git commit -S -m "Test commit to verify signatures"
   git push
  ```
  - In the repository history on GitLab, verify the commit is marked as `verified`.
